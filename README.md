  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  deviceId TEXT NOT NULL,
  deviceName TEXT NOT NULL,
  macAddress TEXT NOT NULL,
  rssi INTEGER NOT NULL,
  latitude REAL,
  longitude REAL,
  timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
  manufacturerData TEXT,
  serviceUuids TEXT,

);
```

## Permissions Required

### Android
- `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`: For discovering nearby devices
- `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`: For device connectivity checks
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: For precise GPS coordinates
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: For general location access
- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`: For continuous location tracking

## Key Dependencies

- `flutter_blue_plus`: Bluetooth Low Energy communication
- `geolocator`: GPS location services
- `sqflite`: Local SQLite database
- `permission_handler`: Runtime permission management
- `intl`: Date/time formatting

## Privacy Considerations

- All data is stored locally on the device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- Location data is only used for device discovery context
- Users can clear all data at any time

## Performance Notes

- Scanning occurs every 30 seconds to balance battery life and data collection
- Database is optimized with indexes for fast queries
- Location updates are filtered to every 10 meters to reduce battery usage
- Old data cleanup functionality prevents excessive storage usage

## Troubleshooting

1. **Bluetooth permissions denied**: Check app permissions in device settings
2. **Location not working**: Ensure location services are enabled
3. **No devices found**: Check if Bluetooth is enabled and try manual scan
4. **App crashes on startup**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Future Enhancements

- Export data to CSV/JSON formats
- Device filtering and search capabilities
- Heat map visualization of device locations
- Background service for 24/7 monitoring
- Data synchronization across devices
- Advanced analytics and reporting

### Coding Style Guidelines

This project follows strict coding style rules for consistency and readability:

#### Core Principles
- **NO ELSE STATEMENTS**: Always use early returns instead of else clauses
- **MINIMAL NESTING**: Keep code flat with maximum 2 levels of nesting
- **EARLY RETURNS**: Use guard clauses and early returns for cleaner code flow

#### Before Contributing
1. Read `.ai-instructions.md` for detailed coding standards
2. Ensure your IDE follows the settings in `.vscode/settings.json`
3. Run `flutter analyze` to check for style violations
4. All new code must follow the no-else, minimal-nesting pattern
5. **Maintain ‚â•80% unit test coverage** - run `flutter test --coverage` to verify

#### Testing Requirements
- **Minimum unit test coverage: 80%** - All changes must maintain or improve coverage
- Add unit tests for all new services, models, and utility functions
- Mock external dependencies (SharedPreferences, platform channels, etc.)
- Handle platform exceptions gracefully in test environments
- Run `flutter test --coverage` before submitting PRs

#### Example Code Patterns

‚úÖ **Good - Early Return Pattern**
```dart
if (!isValid) return;
if (data == null) return;
if (!mounted) return;

processData(data);
```

‚ùå **Bad - Nested/Else Pattern**
```dart
if (isValid) {
  if (data != null) {
    if (mounted) {
      processData(data);
    }
  }
}
```

### Contribution Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Follow coding style guidelines
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

### Testing Standards
**Unit Test Coverage Requirement: ‚â•80%**

Before committing changes:
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Check test results in coverage/lcov.info
# Use VS Code extensions: Flutter Coverage, Coverage Gutters
```

See detailed testing instructions in [test/README.md](test/README.md).

### Code Formatting
This project uses automatic code formatting to maintain consistent code style.

**Pre-commit Hook**: A pre-commit hook automatically runs `dart format` on all staged Dart files before each commit. This ensures all committed code follows consistent formatting standards.

- Hook files are located in `.git/hooks/`
- Setup scripts are available in `scripts/`
- The hook runs automatically - no manual intervention required
- To bypass (not recommended): `git commit --no-verify`

For detailed information, see: üìñ **[Pre-commit Hook Setup Guide](docs/PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_SETUP.md)**

### Manual Formatting
To manually format all Dart files:
```bash
dart format .
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated formatting checks, testing, and building. See the [GitHub Actions Setup Guide](docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md) for details.
